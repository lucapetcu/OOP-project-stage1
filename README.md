# OOP-project-stage1

This is the first stage of my project for the OOP course. The implementation helps Santa
Clause to distribute gifts to children using OOP concepts. First of all, in order to read
the input I used the org.simple.json library and to write the output the Jackson library. I used
some design patterns, such as Singleton for the database class and Visitor in order to 
perform the gift assignation. Also, I used some data structures like LinkedHashMap or ArrayList.
